	Giwa was hired as an administrative assistant in the board's executive offices. The commissioners voted to hire her on the same day Dent handed over her resume.




	Last month, the Conflicts of Interest Board fined board President Jose Miguel Araujo, a Queens Democrat, $10,000 after he admitted to having put his wife on the payroll so the family could get city health benefits.




	In the Conflicts of Interest Board disposition issued Monday, Dent reaffirmed her contention that she recused herself from the vote to hire Giwa, although the minutes of the meeting do not show that any of the 10 commissioners did so.
