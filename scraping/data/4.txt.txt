	"At some point we have to hold these officers criminally liable for killing unarmed people," Williams said in an interview with Geraldo Rivera on WABC radio. "That is a problem."


	He said Probationary Police Officer Peter Liang should not have been patrolling the notoriously crime ridden Pink Houses with his gun drawn.


	"That is a tremendous problem, and I believe some sort of criminal negligence," he said.


	But Williams stressed that Liang was likely well-intentioned.


	"He may have just joined the force to have a positive impact in the community, and was put in a situation that he shouldn't have been," said Williams.


	He doesn't believe that rookie officers should be patrolling high-crime areas like Liang was.


	"It's unfair to the rookie officers," he said.


	The medical examiner ruled on Sunday that Gurley's death was a homicide.
